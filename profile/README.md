# FreeHCI

## Preface

There is a significant lack of low-threshold solutions for HCI. Several alternatives exist, but they often come at a price that doesn't fit into the tight budgets of companies lacking the necessary financial resources and IT expertise. The FreeHCI project was started in response to existing solutions such as Dell EMC VxRail, Nutanix, and HPE Simplivity. The project aims to address the problems and challenges associated with today's market leaders and become a visible contender that challenges established players, demonstrating how new technology, fresh ideas, and a forward-thinking open-source community can provide customers with a better experience.

## Technology

We are strong proponents of openness in how things are built. Openness about potential issues that may arise and how they are resolved. We want to listen to what customers and the community have to say. We may not be world champions, but we do our best to improve continuously. The world is tired of black boxes that promise to solve all problems at a sky-high price, while in reality, suppliers can hide technical debt and poor design behind closed systems. We don't need magical soup in black boxes - we need something that works and can at least be fixed if something breaks. We need something well-documented and widely understood.
